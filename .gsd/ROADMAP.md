- [ ] Functional Contact Form (EmailJS Integration)
- [ ] PSX/Cyber Aesthetic (Global Styling)

## Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Atmosphere
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Objective**: Set up React project, install 3D libraries (Three, Fiber, Drei, GSAP), and implement the core visual environment (starry background + base sphere).
**Requirements**: SPEC Vision, Initial Repository Setup.

### Phase 2: The Particle Sphere
**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Objective**: Implement the interactive particle sphere. The particles should react to cursor proximity (magnetism/repulsion effect) and the sphere should be rotatable (drag/touch).
**Requirements**: SPEC Goal 1 (Immersive 3D Visuals).

### Phase 3: Interactive Points & Navigation
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Verified)
**Objective**: Add the 4 "Points of Interest" to the sphere surface. Implement the logic for clicking/tapping them. 3 will be external links, 1 will trigger the contact form modal/overlay. style them with pastel cold colors.

### Phase 4: Contact Form & Polish
**Status**: ⬜ Not Started
**Objective**: build the contact form modal with GSAP animations. Integrate EmailJS to send data to "matimuzykant@gmail.com". Finalize responsive adjustments and aesthetic details (fonts, neon glows).
