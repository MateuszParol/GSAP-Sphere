# State: DEBUGGING (Machine Handoff)

**Milestone:** v2.0 - Immersive Homepage
**Micro-Phase:** Phase 1 (Optimization) - Debugging
**Current Issue:** Custom Shader Visibility

## Active Context
- **ParticleSphere**: Currently using fallback `PointsMaterial` (Visible Red Dots). Custom shader is broken on current hardware.
- **Starfield**: Fixed (360 volume).
- **Performance**: Optimized (CPU loop removed, Images lazy loaded, filters removed).

## Next Session Goal
Resume debugging `ParticleSphereShader.js` on the new machine following `DEBUG_HANDOFF.md`.
