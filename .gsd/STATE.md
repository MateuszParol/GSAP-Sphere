## Current Position
- **Phase**: 3 (Organic & Mobile Tuned)
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 3 Refinements III executed.
- **Visuals**: Re-introduced **Organic Jitter** (randomness) to particle positions while keeping **Sharp Pixels**. Best of both worlds (Digital Chaos).
- **Mobile Interaction**: Increased **Tap Tolerance** to **40px** and **500ms**. This prevents the "two-finger" requirement by correctly interpreting small single-finger movements as taps, not drags.
