## Current Position
- **Phase**: 3 (Sharp & Mobile Fixed)
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 3 Refinements II executed.
- **Visuals**: Reverted to **Sharp Square Pixels** by removing the glow texture. Kept high contrast colors.
- **Mobile Interaction**: Implemented custom **Tap Detection** logic (time < 400ms, movement < 10px) to solve the conflict between `OrbitControls` drag and click events. Tapping clusters should now reliably trigger the overlay.
