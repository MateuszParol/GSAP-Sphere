# Phase 3 Verification

## Must-Haves
- [x] `useAntiTheft` hook implementation.
- [x] Context Menu disabled.
- [x] DevTools shortcuts (F12, Ctrl+Shift+I) disabled.
- [x] Console Warning implemented.

## Verdict: PASS
Code logic is in place.
*Note: Advanced users can still disable JS or use external tools, but "drive-by" inspection is blocked.*
