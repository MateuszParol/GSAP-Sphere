# Plan 3.1: Static Content Pages

## Objective
Implement the `About` and `Offer` pages with the project's "Sci-Fi / Low Poly" aesthetic. These pages must transition smoothly from the 3D map and retain the immersive feel using glassmorphism and styled components.

## Context
- `.gsd/SPEC.md` (Aesthetics & Design System)
- `src/layouts/MainLayout.jsx` (Layout wrapper)
- `src/components/UI/Navbar.jsx` (Navigation style reference)

## Tasks

<task type="auto">
  <name>Implement About Page</name>
  <files>src/pages/About.jsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the About page content.
    - Use a glassmorphism container (`backdrop-filter: blur`, semi-transparent background).
    - Add a "Bio" section and a "Skills" list (use a data array for skills to render them as "chips" or holographic badges).
    - Ensure typography matches `index.css` (e.g., a futuristic font for headers).
    - Add a subtle entrance animation using `framer-motion` or GSAP (simple fade-in/slide-up).
  </action>
  <verify>grep -q "glassmorphism" src/pages/About.jsx || echo "Check styling"</verify>
  <done>Page renders with bio and skills in a glass card.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Implement Offer Page</name>
  <files>src/pages/Offer.jsx</files>
  <action>
    Create the Offer page content.
    - List services (e.g., "Web Development", "3D Experiences", "Performance Optimization").
    - Use a grid layout for service cards.
    - Each card should have a hover effect (e.g., border glow or slight scale).
    - Maintain the dark/neon color palette.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -q "Services" src/pages/Offer.jsx</verify>
  <done>Page renders service cards with hover effects.</done>
</task>

## Success Criteria
- [ ] `About` page displays Bio and Skills with glassmorphism.
- [ ] `Offer` page displays Services grid with hover effects.
- [ ] Both pages are responsive (readable on mobile).
