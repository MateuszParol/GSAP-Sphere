# Plan 3.3 Summary: Visual Polish & Mobile Fixes

## Completed Tasks
- **Texture-based Glow**: Implemented performant "fake bloom" using generated canvas textures and AdditiveBlending.
- **Sharpening**: Removed random noise from particle positions and cluster generation as requested. Sphere is now perfectly geometric.
- **Mobile Interaction**: Solved touch issues by implementing a larger transparent hitbox mesh that correctly captures raycast events on mobile devices.

## Verification
- **Visuals**: Neon glow effect is visible without post-processing artifacts.
- **Mobile**: Touch events register reliably on clusters.
