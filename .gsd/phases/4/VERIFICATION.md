# Phase 4 Verification: Contact Form & Polish

## Must-Haves
- [x] **Contact Modal UI** — Sci-Fi styled modal opens when clicking "Contact".
- [x] **EmailJS Integration** — Form submits data via `sendContactForm` utility (keys provided by user).
- [x] **Animations** — Modal enters/exits smoothly with GSAP (fade + scale).
- [x] **Global Fonts** — `Rajdhani` (body) and `VT323` (headers) applied via CSS.
- [x] **Responsiveness** — Modal adapts to mobile screens; Sphere interaction locked when modal open.

## Observations
- **Build**: Resolved dependency conflict with `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- **Structure**: Moved `ContactModal` to `src/components/UI` for better organization.

### Verdict: PASS
Project is feature complete. Ready for final user sign-off.
