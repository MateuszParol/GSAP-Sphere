# Phase 3: Interactive Sphere 2.0

## Objective
Revamp the 3D navigation points on the sphere to be more interactive, visually distinct, and mapped to specific routes.

## Spec
- **FeaturePoint Component**: Reusable, interactive 3D point with HTML label.
- **Floating Bubbles**: Tooltips that appear on hover with glassmorphism style.
- **Fixed Routes**: Specific coordinates for optimal visibility of key pages.

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `FeaturePoint.jsx` component.
- [ ] Update `points.js` with fixed route data.
- [ ] Integrate `FeaturePoint` into `ParticleSphere.jsx` (or Scene).
- [ ] Verify navigation and interactions.
